# What

_v9fs_ is the code-name for the linux kernel client implementation of the [Plan 9](https://9p.io/plan9/) remote file system protocol [9p](http://ericvh.github.io/9p-rfc/).  The original kernel port was documented in [this paper](https://www.usenix.org/conference/2005-usenix-annual-technical-conference/presentation/grave-robbers-outer-space-using-9p20).

This Github group contains a mirror of the official [kernel.org development trees](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ericvh/v9fs.git) for v9fs as well as mirrors of several of the more popular servers, as well as support repositories for testing and performance measurement.
